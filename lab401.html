    <h1>Lab 4.1 Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is my my first web page for Lab 4 of GIS 3410 at MSU Denver. I'm honestly quite surprised at how easy HTML is to understand.</p>
    <h2>The Fallen Leaves Tell a Story...</h2>
    <p>Of how a Tarnished became <strong>Elden Lord</strong>.</p>
    <p>In our home, across the fog, in the Lands Between,</p>
    <p>Our seed will look back look back upon us and recall an <strong>Age of Fracture</strong>.</p>
